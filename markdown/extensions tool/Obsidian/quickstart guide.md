## [Symbolic links and junctions](https://help.obsidian.md/Files+and+folders/Symbolic+links+and+junctions)
You can use symbolic links (symlinks) and junctions in your vault to store files outside the vault and system folder.

> [!CAUTION]
> Use at your own risk.
> We strongly advise against using symbolic links.
> By using symbolic links and junctions in your vault, you risk losing or corrupting your data, or crashing Obsidian.
> Make sure you perform regular back-ups of your vault and settings.

> [!CAUTION]
> Below are some limitations or issues we are aware of that you may want to keep in mind:
> + Symlink loops are disallowed, to prevent crashing Obsidian due to an infinite loop.
> + Symlink targets must be fully disjoint from the vault root or any other symlink targets. Disjoint means one folder doesn't contain another, or vice versa. Obsidian ignores any symlink to a parent folder of the vault, or from one folder in the vault to another folder in the same vault. It is a safeguard to ensure you don't end up with duplicated files in your vault, which could cause links to become ambiguous.
> + Symlinks may not play well with Obsidian sync, or any other kind of sync. If the target of a symlink is itself a folder that's synced by a different Obsidian vault, you could (potentially) end up with sync conflicts or data loss. Some sync tools, such as Git, don't follow symlinks, but rather sync the path the symlink points to, which may produce undesirable results if you share your vault with other people that way.
> + Obsidian's file manager can't move files across device boundaries, so if you symlink to a folder on a different drive from your vault, you won't be able to drag files between that folder and other folders using Obsidian's file explorer. (You'll need to use your OS's explorer for such moves, and Obsidian will see the move as a deletion and the creation of a new file. It will also not update any links that depended on the path of that file.)
> + File symlinks (as opposed to folder symlinks) may work, but aren't officially supported at this time. Changes performed outside of Obsidian aren't watched for, so if you change the file directly, Obsidian won't detect the change, update search indexes, etc.
> + Symlinking things under the .obsidian/ folder in order to share them between vaults has a high chance of corrupting your settings, unless you really know what you're doing. If you decide to go this way, at least have backups.

## Configuration
### [Configuration folder](https://help.obsidian.md/Files+and+folders/Configuration+folder)
Obsidian's configuration folder contains all the settings files pertaining to your vault.

By default, your configuration folder is named .obsidian and placed in the vault folder. When using a syncing service, or if you wish to test different profiles in the same vault, you may want to change your config folder.

#### [Changing configuration folder](https://help.obsidian.md/Files+and+folders/Configuration+folder#Changing+your+configuration+folder)
To set your config folder:

1. Open Settings -> Files and Links.
2. In Override config folder, type the name of your profile, starting with a period (.).

For example, `.obsidian-awesome`. Relaunch Obsidian to have the changes take effect.

> [!NOTE]
> Any settings within your configuration folder will not transfer to your new config folder.
> However, your prior configuration folder will remain within your vault folder.

## [Obsidian URI]
### Intro

> [!TIP]
> Obsidian URI is a custom URI protocol supported by Obsidian that lets you trigger various actions.
> Such as opening a note or creating a note.


Obsidian URIs are typically in this format:

```
obsidian://action?param1=value&param2=value
```

where 

`action` parameter is the action that you would like to perform.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> About encoding, the special character must be encoded with [Percent-encoding](Percent-encoding). (It's like special character must be espaced.)
> Ensure that your values are properly URI encoded.
> Some example of [Percent-encoding](Percent-encoding),
> + forward slash characters `/` must be encoded as `%2F`
> + space characters `/` must be encoded as `%20`.

### [Register Obsidian URI](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/Obsidian+URI#Register+Obsidian+URI)
+ On Windows and macOS, running the app once should be sufficient to register the Obsidian URI protocol on your computer.

+ On Linux, it is a much more involved process:

Ensure you create a obsidian.desktop file. See here for details.
Ensure that your desktop file specifies the Exec field as Exec=executable %u. The %u is used to pass the obsidian:// URIs to the app.
If you're using the AppImage installer, you may have to unpack it using Obsidian-x.y.z.AppImage --appimage-extract. Then make sure the Exec directive points to the unpacked executable.

## Sync
### [Set up Obsidian Sync](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Sync/Set+up+Obsidian+Sync)
#### [Prequisite](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Sync/Set+up+Obsidian+Sync#Prerequisites)
+ An Obsidian account. If you don't have one, sign up now.
+ An active Obsidian Sync subscription. If you don't have one, subscribe from your account dashboard.
+ Sync enabled within the Core plugins settings.

#### CAUTION
> [!CAUTION]
> Is your current vault in an iCloud, OneDrive, Dropbox, or other syncing folder? Please read [Can I use a third-party sync with Obsidian Sync?](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Sync/Sync+limitations#Can+I+use+a+third-party+sync+with+Obsidian+Sync%3F) before proceeding.

#### Step
To set up Obsidian Sync, follow these steps.

7. In **Encryption password**, choose a password for your vault. This creates an end-to-end encrypted vault. The vault password is separate from your Obsidian account and can be different for each of your vaults. For more information, refer to [Security and privacy](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Sync/Security+and+privacy).
8. Select **Create**.

## Connect to a remote vault

1. Select **Connect** next to your newly created vault.
2. Enter the password you configured for the vault in the **Encryption password** field if you opted into [end-to-end encryption](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Sync/Security+and+privacy#What%20does%20end-to-end%20encryption%20mean?).
3. Select **Unlock vault**.
4. **Do not start syncing yet.** Check your sync settings in [adjust Obsidian Sync settings](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Sync/Set+up+Obsidian+Sync#Adjust%20Obsidian%20Sync%20settings).
    - If you wish to start syncing immediately, move onto [begin syncing with Obsidian Sync](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Sync/Set+up+Obsidian+Sync#Begin%20syncing%20with%20Obsidian%20Sync).
5. If you haven't already, close or dismiss the pop-up window prompting you to **Exclude Folders** and **Start Syncing**. Proceed to the next step.

#### Adjust Obsidian Sync settings

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Sync** if needed.
2. Toggle the settings under **Selective Sync** and **Vault configuration sync** to indicate which items should be synced to and from the remote vault.
    - **Note**: If you recently disconnected from a remote vault and are reconnecting without an application restart, some settings may already be toggled on.
3. If you make changes to any settings, restart Obsidian completely.
4. Once Obsidian is restarted, return to **Settings** → **Sync**.
