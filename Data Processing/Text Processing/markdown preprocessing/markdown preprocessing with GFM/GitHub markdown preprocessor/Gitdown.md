# Gitdown -- GitHub markdown preprocessor
## appreciation
Thanks to Gajus who developed a GitHub markdown preprocessor -- Gitdown.

## intro
Gitdown is a GitHub markdown preprocessor. 

It streamlines common tasks associated with maintaining a documentation page for a GitHub repository. Including:

+ generating table of contents including documents, using variables.
+ generating URLs and getting information about the repository itself at the time of processing the input.

Gitdown seamlessly integrates with your building scripts.
