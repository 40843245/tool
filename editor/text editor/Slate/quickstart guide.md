## [Why to create Slate?](https://docs.slatejs.org/#why)
+ The editor's "schema" was hardcoded and hard to customize.
+ Transforming the documents programmatically was very convoluted.
+ Serializing to HTML, Markdown, etc. seemed like an afterthought.
+ Re-inventing the view layer seemed inefficient and limiting.
+ Collaborative editing wasn't designed for in advance.
+ The repositories were monolithic, not small and reusable.
+ Building complex, nested documents was impossible. 

## [Principle concept](https://docs.slatejs.org/#principles)
Slate tries to solve the question of `Why to create Slate?` with a few principles:

+ First-class plugins.
+ Schema-less core.
+ Nested document model.
+ Parallel to the DOM.
+ Intuitive commands.
+ Collaboration-ready data model.
+ Clear "core" boundaries.
