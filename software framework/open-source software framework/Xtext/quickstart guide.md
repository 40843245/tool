Xtext is an open-source software framework for developing programming languages and domain-specific languages (DSLs). 

Unlike standard parser generators. 

Xtext generates not only a parser, but also a class model for the abstract syntax tree, 

as well as providing a fully featured, customizable Eclipse-based IDE.

Xtext is being developed in the Eclipse Project as part of the Eclipse Modeling Framework Project and is licensed under the Eclipse Public License.
