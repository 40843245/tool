| way to create a repo | fill in name of repo (required) and choose license before creating a repo. | fill in name of project name (required), domain of url (required) |

## url

Format:

```
https://gitlab.com/{domainName}/{projectName}
```

For example:

```

In GitLab, `codelover30` is the domain.

`GitLabJay30` is specified according my project name.
