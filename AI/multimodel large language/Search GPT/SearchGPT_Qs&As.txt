How to select all company in Taiwan that has more than or equal to 10000 employees in SQL?

First answer:
To select all companies in Taiwan with 10,000 or more employees using SQL, you would typically use a `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the given criteria. Assuming you have a table named `companies` with columns `country` and `employees`, the query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM companies
WHERE country = 'Taiwan' AND employees >= 10000;
```

Here’s a breakdown of the query:
- `SELECT *` selects all columns from the `companies` table.
- `FROM companies` specifies the table to query.
- `WHERE country = 'Taiwan'` filters the results to include only rows where the `country` column is 'Taiwan'.
- `AND employees >= 10000` further filters the results to include only rows where the `employees` column is 10,000 or more.

How to use deep learning with MatLab?

First answer:
To use deep learning with MATLAB, you typically follow these steps:

### 1. **Install MATLAB and Deep Learning Toolbox**
   Ensure you have MATLAB installed along with the Deep Learning Toolbox, which provides functions and tools for designing and training deep neural networks.

### 2. **Prepare Your Data**
   - **Load and Preprocess Data**: Use functions like `imageDatastore` for images or `table` for structured data. Preprocess the data as needed (resizing, normalization, etc.).

   ```matlab
   imds = imageDatastore('path/to/images', 'LabelSource', 'foldernames', 'IncludeSubfolders', true);
   imds.ReadSize = numpartitions(imds);
   ```

### 3. **Define the Network Architecture**
   - **Create Network Layers**: Use functions like `layerGraph` and predefined layer types (`convolution2dLayer`, `fullyConnectedLayer`, `reluLayer`, etc.).

   ```matlab
   layers = [
       imageInputLayer([224 224 3])
       convolution2dLayer(3, 8, 'Padding', 'same')
       reluLayer
       maxPooling2dLayer(2, 'Stride', 2)
       fullyConnectedLayer(10)
       softmaxLayer
       classificationLayer
   ];
   ```

### 4. **Configure Training Options**
   - **Set Training Parameters**: Use `trainingOptions` to specify options such as the optimizer, learning rate, and number of epochs.

   ```matlab
   options = trainingOptions('sgdm', ...
       'InitialLearnRate', 0.01, ...
       'MaxEpochs', 10, ...
       'Shuffle', 'every-epoch', ...
       'ValidationData', imdsValidation, ...
       'Verbose', false, ...
       'Plots', 'training-progress');
   ```

### 5. **Train the Network**
   - **Use `trainNetwork` to Train**: Pass the network architecture, training data, and options to `trainNetwork`.

   ```matlab
   net = trainNetwork(imdsTrain, layers, options);
   ```

### 6. **Evaluate the Network**
   - **Test and Analyze Performance**: Use functions like `classify` to test the network on new data and analyze its performance.

   ```matlab
   YPred = classify(net, imdsTest);
   accuracy = sum(YPred == imdsTest.Labels) / numel(imdsTest.Labels);
   ```

### 7. **Deploy the Network**
   - **Export or Convert Models**: You can export models to other formats or integrate them into applications.

   ```matlab
   save('myTrainedNetwork.mat', 'net');
   ```

### Example Workflow

Here’s a complete example of training a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) on an image dataset:

```matlab
% Load and preprocess data
imds = imageDatastore('path/to/images', 'LabelSource', 'foldernames', 'IncludeSubfolders', true);
imds.ReadSize = numpartitions(imds);
[imdsTrain, imdsValidation] = splitEachLabel(imds, 0.7, 'randomized');

% Define network architecture
layers = [
    imageInputLayer([224 224 3])
    convolution2dLayer(3, 8, 'Padding', 'same')
    reluLayer
    maxPooling2dLayer(2, 'Stride', 2)
    fullyConnectedLayer(10)
    softmaxLayer
    classificationLayer
];

% Set training options
options = trainingOptions('sgdm', ...
    'InitialLearnRate', 0.01, ...
    'MaxEpochs', 10, ...
    'Shuffle', 'every-epoch', ...
    'ValidationData', imdsValidation, ...
    'Verbose', false, ...
    'Plots', 'training-progress');

% Train the network
net = trainNetwork(imdsTrain, layers, options);

% Evaluate the network
YPred = classify(net, imdsValidation);
accuracy = sum(YPred == imdsValidation.Labels) / numel(imdsValidation.Labels);
disp(['Validation Accuracy: ', num2str(accuracy)]);
```

This workflow provides a basic structure. Depending on your specific needs and the complexity of your data and network, you might need to adjust the architecture, data preparation, and training options.

OOP
*/

What is OOP?

First answer:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of methods (functions or procedures). The fundamental principles of OOP include:

### 1. **Encapsulation**
   Encapsulation involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It hides the internal state of the object from the outside world and only exposes a controlled interface. This helps in reducing complexity and increasing reusability.

   ```python
   class Car:
       def __init__(self, make, model):
           self.make = make
           self.model = model

       def display_info(self):
           return f"Car: {self.make} {self.model}"
   ```

### 2. **Abstraction**
   Abstraction simplifies complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors an object should have. It allows programmers to focus on interactions at a high level without worrying about the underlying details.

   ```python
   class Animal:
       def make_sound(self):
           pass  # Abstract method

   class Dog(Animal):
       def make_sound(self):
           return "Bark"
   ```

### 3. **Inheritance**
   Inheritance allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and methods from an existing class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

   ```python
   class Vehicle:
       def start_engine(self):
           return "Engine started"

   class Car(Vehicle):
       def honk(self):
           return "Honk!"
   ```

### 4. **Polymorphism**
   Polymorphism enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. It allows methods to be used interchangeably based on the object’s type. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding (in subclass) and method overloading (in some languages).

   ```python
   class Bird:
       def fly(self):
           return "Flying"

   class Sparrow(Bird):
       def fly(self):
           return "Sparrow flying"

   def let_it_fly(bird):
       print(bird.fly())

   sparrow = Sparrow()
   let_it_fly(sparrow)  # Outputs: Sparrow flying
   ```

### Benefits of OOP
- **Modularity**: Code is organized into classes and objects, making it easier to manage and understand.
- **Reusability**: Classes and methods can be reused across different programs.
- **Maintainability**: Encapsulation and abstraction simplify maintenance and enhancement.
- **Scalability**: OOP principles facilitate the development of scalable and extensible software systems.

### Common OOP Languages
- **Java**
- **C++**
- **Python**
- **C#**
- **Ruby**

These languages support OOP principles and provide frameworks and libraries to facilitate object-oriented design and development.
